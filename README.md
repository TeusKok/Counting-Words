Ordina Assessment

I created a class that implements the WordFrequency interface.
I also created a class that implements the WordFrequencyAnalyzer interface.
The three methods defined in the WordFrequencyAnalyzer were also implemented.

Since I have no experience with REST interfaces and could not manage to find out
how they work and what I should do within the given time, therefore I did not execute this part.

Further elaboration on the workings of the code is included in the comments in the code.
